# ✈️ Passenger Satisfaction and Delay Dynamics
**Module:** INM430 Principles of Data Science — City, University of London

This project analyses patterns, causes, and impacts of flight delays and how they affect passenger satisfaction.

## 🧰 Stack
Python · Pandas · Seaborn · Matplotlib · Scikit-learn · Jupyter

## 🔍 Methods
- Data cleaning & handling missing values  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Correlation & regression analysis  
- Visualization of delay impact  

## 📈 Key Insights
- Weather and maintenance are major contributors to long delays.  
- Passenger satisfaction drops sharply with longer delays.  
- Recommendations focus on improving operational efficiency.
