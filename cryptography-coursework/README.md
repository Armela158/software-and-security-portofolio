## 🧠 Overview
This project simulates the work of an **ethical hacker** investigating and exploiting vulnerabilities in a controlled lab environment.  
Tasks included penetration testing, brute-force attacks, email cryptanalysis, and RSA decryption using **SageMath**.

The coursework demonstrates understanding of:
- Encryption/decryption fundamentals  
- Network reconnaissance  
- Password cracking techniques  
- RSA key computation and recovery  
- Secure collaboration and verification using Shamir’s Secret Sharing  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Kali Linux** (VMware Horizon Client)  
- **Hydra** – dictionary-based SSH attack  
- **Nmap / Zenmap** – network reconnaissance  
- **John the Ripper** – password cracking  
- **CrypTool** – cipher verification  
- **SageMath** – RSA decryption and modular arithmetic

## 🔍 Key Tasks
| Task | Description |
|------|--------------|
| Network Scanning | Identified open ports and active hosts (SSH, SQL) |
| Brute Force Attack | Used Hydra to crack SSH and SQL admin passwords |
| Email Analysis | Retrieved encrypted email data from `/Maildir` |
| Cryptanalysis | Frequency analysis & GCD method to derive cipher key |
| RSA Operations | Computed public key `e=19`, private key `d=1637`, and decrypted secret code `692` |
| Collaboration | Group calculations using Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme |
