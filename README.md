## 🧩 Overview
This repository is a curated collection of my **academic and practical cybersecurity work**, developed during my MSc in Cybersecurity at **City, University of London**.  
It showcases coursework, research, and independent projects spanning **cryptography, digital forensics, network security, data analysis**, and **secure system auditing**.  

Each folder includes a `README.md` file summarising objectives, methods, and outcomes — written in a professional, report-style format.
